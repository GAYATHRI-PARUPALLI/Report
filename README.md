Uncovering Community Insights: A Statistical Analysis of Demographic and Economic Variables in U.S. Counties
This project uses SAS (Statistical Analysis System) to analyze a dataset related to counties in the United States. The primary goal of the project is to uncover insights into societal dynamics by examining how different demographic variables interact with each other. The dataset includes various economic, educational, health, and urbanization metrics, such as poverty rates, unemployment rates, homeownership, median household income, per-capita income, multi-unit apartment rates, metropolitan status, population, and smoking ban policies.
